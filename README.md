# AnnotQC:An-application-to-summarize-genome-annotation-to-assess-quality

## The problem: 

Genomic annotation programs often provide a number of useful metrics to access the quality of the annotation. However, these program often output data in the form of .gff or .xml files, which cannot be visualized easily. It is our aim to develop software that can take .gff or .xml files as input and generate a remote highlighted the attributes of the genomic data analyzed.
