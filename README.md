# AnnotQC: Visualizing genome annotation metrics

## The problem: 

Genome annotation programs often provide a number of useful metrics to access the quality of the annotation. However, these programs often output data in the form of .gff or .xml files, which cannot be visualized easily. It is our aim to develop software that can take .gff or .xml files as input and generate a report that highlights the attributes of the genomic data analyzed. 

## How to use our program

AnnotQC operates from a Jupyter Notebook which can be accessed using the button below:

### Dependencies 

Since AnnotQC is run using a Binder ***there is no need to install any packages on your own computer***. The Binder link above will open a virtual machine complete with all necessary packages.
